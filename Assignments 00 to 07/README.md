# Python Projects - Assignments 00 to 07

Welcome to the **Python Projects Repository** for Assignments 00 to 07! 🐍 This repository contains Python projects that were developed as part of my learning journey. These projects cover a wide range of concepts from basic programming skills to web applications.

## Projects

### 00. **Basic Python Syntax and Introduction** 📝
This project includes exercises related to basic Python syntax, such as variable declarations, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions. It's designed to get started with the fundamentals of Python programming.

### 01. **Mad Libs Game** 🎉
A fun interactive game where the user inputs words and those words are inserted into a pre-defined story template, creating funny or random results. This project helps practice string formatting and user input handling.

### 02. **Guess the Number Game (Computer)** 🎮
A simple game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user must guess the number. The game gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low. It’s a great introduction to loops and conditionals.

### 03. **Guess the Number Game (User)** 🎮
In this version of the game, the user selects a number, and the computer must guess it. The computer guesses using a binary search approach, making it a fun challenge. This project is great for learning about loops and conditional logic.

### 04. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** ✊✋✌️
The classic rock-paper-scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game includes random choices for the computer and conditionals to determine the winner. This project is perfect for understanding the use of conditionals and random number generation.

### 05. **Hangman Game** 🤐
The classic word-guessing game where the user tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. If the user makes too many wrong guesses, the game ends. It’s an excellent project to practice string manipulation and user input handling.

### 06. **Countdown Timer** ⏳
A countdown timer that allows the user to set a specific time (in minutes and seconds) and counts down until it reaches zero. This project focuses on using Python’s `time` module and loops to manage time.

### 07. **Password Generator** 🔑
A simple program that generates strong passwords. The user can specify the length of the password, and the program will include special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters. This project introduces randomization and string manipulation techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run these projects locally, you'll need Python installed on your computer (Python 3 or higher). You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
