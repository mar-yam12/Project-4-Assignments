# Python Projects - Assignments 1 to 9

Welcome to the **Python Projects Repository**! 📚 This repository contains various Python projects developed as part of my assignments from Assignments 1 to 9. Each project is focused on solving different real-world problems using Python and relevant libraries.

## Projects

### 1. **Mad Libs Game** 📝
A fun project where the user inputs words and those words are inserted into a pre-defined story to create funny or random results. This project helps practice string formatting and user input handling.

### 2. **Guess the Number Game (Computer)** 🎮
A simple game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user must guess the number. The game provides hints whether the guess is too high or too low. This project is great for learning loops and conditionals.

### 3. **Guess the Number Game (User)** 🎮
In this version of the game, the user selects a number, and the computer must guess it. The computer tries to guess using a binary search method, making it a fun twist. It’s a great exercise for practicing logic and loops.

### 4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** ✊✋✌️
The classic rock-paper-scissors game where the user plays against the computer. This project is a simple way to practice conditionals and random number generation.

### 5. **Hangman Game** 🎲
A fun game where the user has to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. If the user guesses wrong too many times, they lose. This project focuses on string manipulation and handling user input.

### 6. **Countdown Timer** ⏳
A countdown timer program that allows the user to input a specific time (in minutes and seconds) and counts down until it reaches zero. This project is good for learning about time manipulation and loops.

### 7. **Password Generator** 🔑
A tool that generates strong passwords with the option to specify the length and complexity (including special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters). This project is useful for understanding string handling and randomization.

### 8. **BMI Calculator Web App** 🏋️‍♂️
A simple Streamlit app that calculates BMI based on user input (weight and height) and gives the result with an interpretation. This project utilizes Streamlit for creating web-based applications and data visualization.

### 9. **Full Website Project with Streamlit** 🌐
A fully functional website developed using Streamlit for displaying various information, offering user interaction, and providing a smooth UI. This project showcases how to build interactive, user-friendly websites with Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the projects locally, you need Python (version 3 or above) installed on your machine. You may also need to install a few libraries, which can be done using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
